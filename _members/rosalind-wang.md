Rosalind is a second-year PhD student in Pharmaceutical Sciences. They got their B.A. in Neuroscience and Mathematics with a minor in General Music at Northwestern University. There, they completed an honor thesis under [Dr. Richard Silverman](https://silverman.northwestern.edu/) and [Dr. Hande Ozdinler](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/ozdinler/index.html) on the development of a treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Consciousness and psychoactive substances have been their big passion and were what sparked their interest in science when they were studying violin in music school. They wish to investigate the role of interneurons in regulating the states of consciousness. Outside of the lab, they spend most of their leisure time on rock music, games, and yo-yo.
